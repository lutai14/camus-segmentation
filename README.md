# camus-segmentation

# Installation
1. To install the required packages, create a new conda environment using the provided YAML file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    ```

2. Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate echosegmentation
    ```

3. Since PyTorch is OS- and CUDA-dependent, install `pytorch` and `torchvision` according to your machine. For this, use [light-the-torch](https://github.com/pmeier/light-the-torch), a small utility included in the provided YAML file that auto-detects compatible CUDA versions from the local setup and installs the correct PyTorch binaries without user interference. Use the following command:
    ```bash
    ltt install torch torchvision
    ```

4. TorchIO is used for efficient loading, preprocessing and augmentation of medical images. Since TorchIO should be installed *after* PyTorch, run the following command: 

    ```bash
    pip install torchio
    ```

5. Finally, install nnU-Net as an _integrative framework_. This repository already contains a copy of [MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) as of Feb 3, 2023. All you need to do is:
    ```bash
    cd models/nnUNet
    pip install -e .
    ```

# The dataset
The CAMUS challenge uses the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for 2D echocardiographic assessment. It contains 2D apical four-chamber and two-chamber view sequences acquired from 500 patients. 

## Data download
Download both _training_ and _testing_ data from the [download website](https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/6373703d73e9f0047faa1bc8), then move the unzipped `training` and `testing` folders to `data/camus`.

The `/data` folder should look like the following:
```bash
data/
├── training/
│   ├── patient0001/
│   ├── patient0002/
│   └── ...
└── testing/
    ├── patient0002/
    ├── patient0001/
    └── ...
```

## Data pre-processing
The CAMUS dataset is converted to an HDF5 file for fast I/O. This significantly speeds up the computations and consequently the training of the models. During the conversion, the iamges are also resized to 512x512 px. To convert the dataset into HDF5, navigate to the `data/camus/` directory and run the `camus_hdf5_conversion.py` script:

```bash
cd data/camus/
python camus_hdf5_conversion.py
```

# Training
## nnU-Net
### Environment variables
First of all, the nnU-Net requires some environment variables to be set. Navigate to the `architectures/nnUNet/` directory, then type the following in your terminal:

```bash
export nnUNet_raw_data_base="./data/nnUNet_raw_data_base"
export nnUNet_preprocessed="./data/nnUNet_preprocessed"
export RESULTS_FOLDER="./trained_models"
```

#### Data conversion
nnU-Net expects datasets in a structured format. This format closely (but not entirely) follows the data structure of
the [Medical Segmentation Decthlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/). A conversion script is provided in `segmentation/nnUNet/` named `camus_MSD_conversion.py`. Running it will populate the `data/nnUNet_raw_data_base` folder.

### Training
1. Before training, nnU-Net requires the _Experiment planning and preprocessing_ step. In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess -t 570 -pl3d None --verify_dataset_integrity
    ```
2. Train the model. Run:
    ```bash
    nnUNet_train 2d nnUNetTrainerV2 570 X --npz
    ```
    For the 5 required folds, i.e. for `X=[0,1,2,3,4]`.

3. Find the best nnU-Net configuration:
    ```bash
    nnUNet_find_best_configuration -m 2d -t 570
    ```



## Inference
To run inference on the test set, please run:
```bash
nnUNet_predict -i ./data/nnUNet_raw_data_base/nnUNet_raw_data/Task570_CAMUS/imagesTs -o ./output/Task570_CAMUS -tr nnUNetTrainerV2 -ctr nnUNetTrainerV2CascadeFullRes -m 2d -p nnUNetPlansv2.1 -t Task570_CAMUS
```

## Evaluation
The evaluation of the segmentation results is evaluated on the ED and ES frames using the [CAMUS submission platform](http://camus.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/challenge/#challenge/5ca20fcb2691fe0a9dac46c8). The raw nnU-Net outputs need to be converted into MHD files that can be correctly processed by the platform. Please run the `process_outputs.py` script and upload the resulting MHD files (saved in the `output` folder) on the submission website.
