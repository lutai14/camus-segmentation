# The dataset
The CAMUS challenge uses the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for 2D echocardiographic assessment. It contains 2D apical four-chamber and two-chamber view sequences acquired from 500 patients and is made available for download [here](http://camus.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/challenge/#challenges).
